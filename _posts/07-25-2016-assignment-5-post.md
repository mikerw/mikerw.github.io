For this assignment, our group had the joy of learning how to write scripts!

The purpose of this particular script is to ask the user a few questions about themselves and their experience here at UNC.
The script then takes the answers they input and stores them in a database using a shell called MySql.
The purpose of this is to simplify the process of looking at and manipulating data in a database, and to be able to open up this data
in many different formats for different purposes.

We learned a lot about executing demands in sequence and trouble shooting when the commands don't quite work in the way we want them to
(which happened so.. many... times..). This was a very enlightening experience!

Here is a link to the repository that contains our script: [Team Eureka script](https://github.com/dariseejr/task-5-database-interface)
