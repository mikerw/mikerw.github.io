This assignment introduced us to a new, flexible, and intuitive form of creating presentations based on writing code, rather than using
a presentation generator such as PowerPoint.

Our presentation is about the ever-so-important and life-changing events currently underway between Kanye and Kim West and Taylor Swift.

The presentation speaks for itself. Here is a link. Check it out!
