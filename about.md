My name is Michael Wallace. I was born and raised in the little town of Sanford, North Carolina, not far from where we are now. 
I graduated highschool in 2011, and I have attended two community colleges, Sandhills Community College and Central Carolina Community College (CCCC), since.
In May of 2015, I graduated from CCCC with an Associate in Science degree.
I now attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and I am majoring in Environmental Science with a concentration in Energy and Sustainability 
and a minor in Geology.

I have been given the wonderful opportunity to study abroad in Thailand in the Spring and Summer of 2017 for my major!
There, I will study at the Joint Graduate School of Energy and Environment at King Mongkut's University of Technology - Thonburi (JGSEE-KMUTT) in Bangkok, Thailand.
During the spring semester I will take five courses at the university, and in the summer I will have the amazing opportunity to complete a capstone 
research project!

This will be my first time out of the country (besides a cruise to Jamaica when I was 15, which only lasted a couple days).
I am incredibly nervous and excited about the six months I will be spending in this extremely foreign country.
This will be an experience of a life time, and I hope it is not my only trip abroad in life to practice the uber essential science of the environment!
